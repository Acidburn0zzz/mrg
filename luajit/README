If you've built and installed cairo and microraptor gui, and have luajit
installed and in the path, you should be able to directly run test.lua

Most API of Micro-raptor gui is bound, functions taking callbacks as function
pointers in C are properly memory managed - otherwise luajit quickly runs out
of resources.
