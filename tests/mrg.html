      <h1>MicroRaptor Gui</h1>
      
      <p>MicroRaptor Gui is a C API for creating user interfaces, it can be
      used as an application writing environment or as an interactive canvas
      for part of a larger interface.</p>

      <p>Drawing with microraptor is done using <a
        href='http://cairographics.org/'>cairo</a>. Interspersed with the
      cairo drawing calls you can register motion, press and drag <a
        href='events.html'>pointer
        event</a> callbacks rectangles for the drawn scene.

      <a href='bindings.html'>Key bindings</a> are also registered while/after
      drawing.  For control over styling (and positioning) of text and other
      elements micro raptor uses <a href='css.html'>CSS</a>/<a
        href='xhtml.html'>XHTML</a>, in mrg
      pushing and popping named style contexts corresponds to the nesting
      hierarchy of a DOM.</p>

      <h3>Backends / dependencies</h3>

      <p>MicroRaptor Gui has three <span style="font-size:0.8em;">independent</span> backends it can use, SDL-1.2,
      GTK+-3.0 and ANSI/vt100 terminals, the GTK backend provides both full
      application hosting, and a widget for use as a canvas in
      GTK+applications. The terminal backends has mouse support, is utf8
      native and for simple text-centric applications you can even build
      static libraries skipping even the cairo support.</p>
      
      <h3>Immediate mode UIs</h3>
      <p>
      In terms of programming paradigm, microraptor contains aspects of 
      both traditional retained widget-tree/scene-graph ui's and 
      <a href="http://iki.fi/sol/imgui/">(purist) immediate mode uis</a>.
      Since microraptor doesn't have a retained scenegraph, and some of
      the freedoms gained with <em>imgui</em>, like being able to paint
      incrementally directly from data-structures are also gained
      with microraptor.
